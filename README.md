# Nexus RDF

The project is a collection of small libraries that facilitate the interaction with [JSON-LD] and [RDF Graphs]. More concretely, they provide:

- Iri ([rfc 3987](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)) implementation.
- JSON-LD <-> RDF Graph transformations.
- RDF Graph navigation.
- RDF Graph querying.
- RDF Graph manipulation (additions, deletions).
