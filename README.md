# Nexus RDF

The project is a collection of small libraries. They facilitate the interaction with [JSON-LD] and [RDF Graphs]. More concretely, they provide:

- Iri ([rfc 3987](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)) implementation.
- JSON-LD <-> RDF Graph transformations.
- RDF Graph navigation.
- RDF Graph querying.
- RDF Graph manipulation (additions, deletions).

[RDF Graphs]: https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-graph
[JSON-LD]: https://json-ld.org/

## Repository was discontinued

The code has been moved to the [main nexus repository](https://github.com/bluebrain/nexus) as a module
and its development will continue there.
